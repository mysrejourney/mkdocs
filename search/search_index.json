Exporters are nothing but a process running in a target machine. It collects the metrics data from the target machine and converts them to the format that prometheus can understand. Then exporters expose the metrics to an HTTP endpoint. Retrieval components will make a call to this endpoint and scrape  the metrics (pull the metrics) for this target machine.</p> <p>Short-lived Jobs &amp; Push Gateway</p> <p>Assume that we need to monitor some job that lives short (let's say 5 seconds), and our scraping interval in the prometheus server configured as 15 seconds. By the time the scraping starts, the job must have terminated, and we lose the metrics for that job. </p> <p>To avoid losing the jobs metric, there is another component named <code>push gateway</code> involved. Short-lived jobs push the metric to push gateway, and prometheus server will scrape the metrics from push gateway.</p> <p>Service Discovery</p> <p>In general, prometheus expects all the target details to be configured in the configuration file. However, these are static details such as IP address, and port. In the case of dynamic environment like kubernetes, AWS EC2 instances, the target details will be dynamic. To handle this situation, Service discovery is in place.

Hence, a variable file needs to be updated like below</p> <pre><code>variable \"filename\" {\n    type=set(string) # should be added to convert the list type to set type\n    default = [\"./test.txt\",\"sample.txt\",\"goal.txt\"]\n}\n</code></pre> <p>or </p> <pre><code>resource \"local_file\" \"my-file\" {\n    filename = each.value\n    for_each = toset(var.filename)\n    content=\"\"\n</code></pre> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>As seen in the snapshot, there are three files have been created.</p> <p>We can do the same as below as well.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>As seen in the snapshot, there are three files have been created.</p> <p>Version Constraints</p> <p>This will be helpful to use the specific version of the specific provider.</p> <p>When you run <code>terraform init</code> command, this will automatically download the latest version of the provider plugin that are needed for the configuration file. Sometimes, the functionality of the provider plugin will vary between the versions. In that case, we need to download a specific provider plugin to create the resources using a terraform configuration file.</p> <p>For example, the local_file resource provider latest version (at the time of writing) is 2.5.3.</p> <p></p> <p>In case, if we want to use the local_file resource provider version 2.5.0, we need to use the below code snippet</p> <pre><code>terraform {\n  required_providers {\n    local = {\n      source = \"hashicorp/local\"\n      version = \"2.5.0\" ## Specific version to be mentioned here\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Example</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>We can use the version value in different ways.</p> Value Description version=\"!=2.5.0\" Any version other than 2.5.0 would be okay to download version=\"&lt;2.5.0\" Any version greater than 2.5.0 would be okay to download version=\"&gt;2.5.0\" Any version less than 2.5.0 would be okay to download version=\"!=2.5.0, &gt;2.4.1, &lt;2.5.2\" Any version other than 2.5.0 and greater than 2.4.1 and less than 2.5.2 would be okay to download version=\"~&gt;2.4\" Any version from 2.4, 2.5, 2.6 etc would be okay to download version=\"~&gt;2.4.0\" Any version from 2.4.0, to 2.4.9 etc would be okay to download"},{"location":"tips/shell-script/","title":"Shell","text":""},{"location":"tips/shell-script/#tips-and-simple-code-snippets","title":"Tips and Simple Code Snippets","text":""},{"location":"tips/shell-script/#use-of-curly-braces","title":"Use of curly braces {}","text":"<ul> <li>If you want to concatenate the variable value with other strings/numbers, then curly braces for variable is mandatory.</li> </ul> <pre><code>weight=71\n# Without curly braces for variable weight\necho \"Without curly braces = My weight is $weightkgs\"\n\n# With curly braces for variable weight\necho \"With curly braces = My weight is ${weight}kgs\"\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"tips/shell-script/#use-of-double-quotes","title":"Use of double quotes \"\"","text":"<ul> <li>If you have a variable contains spaces, then double quotes for variable will process the variable as a whole.
