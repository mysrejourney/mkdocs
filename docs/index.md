# Welcome to my SRE journey website

Let me introduce.

I am Satheesh Pandian from Bangalore, working in one of the premier banks in India as Senior Site Reliability Engineer. 
I have been in IT industry since 2006 right after my post-graduation in Master of Technology.

Though I started my career with Performance testing, eventually I landed upon performance engineering and optimization 
for quite some time. Then, I took diversion and started learning new skills and became Sr.SRE.
I started to capture whatever I learnt over the period of time in this website. I am sure this will help some of you 
while working.

Keep learning and NEVER QUIT. Learning is a continuous process until we die.
