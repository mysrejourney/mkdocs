# Welcome to my SRE journey

Let me introduce first.

`I am Satheesh Pandian from Bangalore, working in one of premier bank in India as Senior Site Realibility Engineer.

`Though I started my career with Performance testing, eventually I landed upon performance engineering and optimization for quite sometime. Then, I took diversion and started learning new skills and become Sr.SRE. I started captured whatever I learnt over the period of time in this website. I am sure this will help some of you while working`
