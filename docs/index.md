# Welcome to my SRE journey website

Let me introduce first.

I am Satheesh Pandian from Bangalore, working in one of premier bank in India as Senior Site Reliability Engineer. 
I have been in IT industry since 2006 right after my post graduation in Master of Technology. 
Though, I am not from computer educational background, I started learning technical skills while working in multiple companies 
such as Infosys, Capgemini, IBM, Volvo Cars and IDFC First Bank.

Though I started my career with Performance testing, eventually I landed upon performance engineering and optimization for quite some time. 
Then, I took diversion and started learning new skills and become Sr.SRE. I started to capture whatever I learnt over the period of time in this website. 
I am sure this will help some of you while working.

Keep learning and NEVER QUIT.Learning is continuous process until we die.
