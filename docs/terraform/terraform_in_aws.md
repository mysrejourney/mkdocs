###Introduction to IAM (Identity and Access Management)

When we create users in AWS, there are two types of access that we can configure to the users.

<mark>1. Management Console Access : User should have valid username and password to access</mark>
<mark>2. Programmatic Access: User should have access key id and secret access key and using via CLI. But they CANNOT access management console.</mark>


When the user created,we need to assign the permission via IAM policy in AWS. This policy tells you that what user can do or cannot do.
