`TRIVIA: Who created world's first website?`

`Answer: Sir Tim Berners-Lee`


HTML defines the content and structure of the website. 

## Element
Combination of tags and content is called as HTML Element
```html
<STARTING TAG>CONTENT</CLOSING TAG>
```

## Tags
Elements are surrounded by tags.
```html
<STARTING TAG></CLOSING TAG>
```
In General, CLOSING TAG is nothing but a STARTING TAG along with "/"

Example:
```html
<h4>Satheesh</h4>
```
Whereas, 

- `<h4>` = Starting tag 
- `</h4>` = Closing tag
- `Satheesh` = Content

## Best Practices

1. Keep only one h1 element in the web page
2. Do not skip header elements (don't go from h1 to h3. Always go h1, h2 and so on.)
