`TRIVIA: Who created world's first website?`

`Answer: Sir Tim Berners-Lee`


HTML defines the content and structure of the website. 

##Element
Combination of tags and content is called as HTML Element
```html
<STARTING TAG>CONTENT</CLOSING TAG>
```

##Tags
Elements are surrounded by tags.
```html
<STARTING TAG></CLOSING TAG>
```
In General, CLOSING TAG is nothing but a STARTING TAG along with "/"

Example:
```html
<h4>Satheesh</h4>
```
Whereas, 
- `<h4>` = Starting tag 
- `</h4>` = Closing tag
- `Satheesh` = Content
