# Introduction to Cloudwatch (CW)

Cloudwatch is one of the services provided by AWS used to monitor the system and application health.
It can monitor the AWS resources, AWS infrastructure and on-premises application as well.
It can collect the logs, metrics from other AWS resources and helpful for taking decision based on the details.

System monitoring is alone not helpful in any application.
It requires a proactive mechanism to stop that event when it occurs.
Alerting is one such mechanism can help, and it is part of cloudwatch service.
